# sv3c_decrypt

Decrypter/encrypter for SDVX E-AMUSE CLOUD. Useful to edit resource files
for English translations, for example.

As filenames are obfuscated as a hash, you cannot simply browse the filesystem,
you must know the filenames. As a convenience, I have included a list of
filenames used. There is 1 file with an unknown name.

Works for SV3C alpha, beta and the full release.

### Setup:
`pip install python-camellia tqdm`

Additionally for Python 2:  
`pip install future`

I hope the code is self explanatory.
